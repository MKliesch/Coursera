# General Information
Switzerland is famous for its mountains, lakes, and, among many other things, its well-functioning public transport. However, public transport is only ever as good as its connection to the remotest places. So I was wondering, if you want to live in the countryside, how many places are there in Switzerland that are small (in population size) and still well connected to the two major cities Zurich and Bern? How many trains per hour go to Zurich/Bern and how long do they take to get there?


# The Dataset  {.tabset}
The dataset contains information about population size and public transport connections of all populated places in Switzerland that have public transport connections to Zurich or Bern.

##  Column names
The dataset consists of `r nrow(all)` rows and `r ncol(all)` columns with the following column names:

```{r colnames, echo = F}
allData <- as.data.frame(allData)

str(allData)
```

## Data description

* `userCode` - ID of the participan
...

## Example data

```{r head, echo = F}
head(allData)
```

# The Plots

```{r Zurich, echo = F}
#all$color ...

all %>% 
  leaflet() %>% # make a map
  addTiles() %>% # brings in mapping data
  addCircles(radius = 10, popup = paste(all$name, paste("Size: ", all$population), paste("Trains to Zurich per h: ", all$toZhPerHAny), paste("Av. commute time: ", all$durationToZh), sep = "\n"))

```

```{r Bern, echo = F}
#all$color ...

all %>% 
  leaflet() %>% # make a map
  addTiles() %>% # brings in mapping data
  addCircles(radius = 10, popup = paste(all$name, paste("Size: ", all$population), paste("Trains to Bern per h: ", all$toBePerHAny), paste("Av. commute time: ", all$durationToBe), sep = "\n"))

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
